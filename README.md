### Welcome!

I'm Joachim Str√∂mbergson, an embedded and hardware focused IT security consultant living in Gothenburg, Sweden. Out of passion as well as professionally, I develop open hardware implementations of cryptographic functions such as ciphers, hash functions, message authentication functions, random number generators. Several of my cores have been used in ASIC and FPGA designs. Please check the status information in the README of the core you are interested in for its readiness and maturity.

For custom core development, adaptions to your specific needs and integration assistance, [please contact me Assured](https://www.assured.se/contact)
